## How to Install

1. Install **Npcap**:  
   https://npcap.com/#download  
   - You **must** check **“Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode”**

2. Download the latest release and install:  
   👉 https://github.com/taengu/Aion2-Dps-Meter/releases

3. If AION 2 is already running, **go to the character selection screen first**.

4. Run `aion2meter-tw.exe` **as Administrator** *(installs to C:\Program Files\aion2meter-tw by default)*

5. **Allow Windows Firewall** prompt when you first open the app.
   - Preferably, expand the menu and tick Private and Public.
   - This helps ensure data isn't being missed

6. If the DPS meter does not appear:
   - Teleport using a **Kisk**, **Hideout**, or enter/exit a dungeon
   - Then repeat steps **3–4**

7. If the meter stops working after previously functioning:
   - Teleport or enter a dungeon again to refresh packet capture
   - If it still does not work, restart from step **3**

## FAQ

**Q: What's different from the original meter?**
- The original was written for KR servers and uses a hard-coded method for finding game packets.
- This version adds auto-detection and support for VPNs/Ping Reducers. It also has been translated to English skills/spells and UI.

**Q: All names/my name shows as numbers?**
- Name detection can take a little time to work due to the game not sending names that often
- You can use a teleport scroll or teleport to Legion to try and get it to detect your name faster
- To save on teleports, if you use Exitlag, enable "Shortcut to restart all connections" option and use it to reload the game and populate names faster.

**Q: The UI appears, but no damage is shown.**  
- Verify Npcap installation  
- Exit the app, go to character select, then relaunch

**Q: I see DPS from others but not myself.**  
- DPS is calculated based on the monster with the highest total damage  
- Use the same training dummy as the player(s) already showing on the meter.

**Q: Contribution is not 100% while solo.**  
- Name capture may have failed

**Q: Are chat or command features supported?**  
- Not currently

**Q: Hit count is higher than skill casts.**  
- Multi-hit skills count each hit separately

**Q: Some skills show as numbers.**  
- These are usually Theostones  
- Report others via GitHub Issues
